# **My Professional Certifications**

Welcome to my certifications repository!

This repository serves as a single, organised location to host and showcase all my professional certifications. Since some certificate providers offer links that are prone to expiration or inaccessibility, I have uploaded static versions of these certificates here for easy, long-term access.

---

## **Project Description**
This project serves as a centralised and reliable archive for my professional certifications. By uploading static versions of my certificates to a version-controlled environment like GitHub, I ensure they remain accessible even if external links become inactive. This repository also promotes transparency for professional networking, job applications, and skill verification. Moreover, it provides an organised and easily searchable format to showcase my achievements.  

This repository reflects my dedication to continuous learning and professional growth.

## **Purpose of This Repository**
- **Unified Showcase:** A central place to host all certifications I have earned.
- **Accessibility:** Overcomes broken or time-limited certificate links provided by issuing organisations.
- **Transparency:** Allows others to verify and recognise my accomplishments.
